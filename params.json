{"name":"MIDAS - The Microbial Database of Activated Sludge","tagline":"A database and taxonomy of microbes in activated sludge","body":"The publically available databases are an invaluable resource for the scientific \r\ncommunity. However, the curation of a taxonomy over all Bacteria and Archaea is a \r\ncollosal undertaking we found that many new names were missing from the taxonomy \r\nand many of the clades of importance in activated sludge were poorly classified.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of the MIDAS database is to deliver the best and most updated taxonomy \r\nof organisms found in activated sludge ecosystem. The taxonomy strings used are derived\r\nfrom and compatible with the widely-used [Greengenes](http://greengenes.lbl.gov/) \r\ndatabase but is curated mostly at the lower taxonomic levels to improve classification \r\nat family and genus level. \r\n\r\n## Use\r\n\r\nInitially, the taxonomy supports a taxfile for the [RDP classifier](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classifier/)\r\nwhich we use in the [Qiime](http://qiime.org/) pipeline.\r\n\r\nSimply use midas_taxonomy.txt as the taxonomy file for running the RDP classifier \r\nin conjuction with the gg_97_otus_4feb2011.fasta in place of the standard taxfile.\r\n\r\n## Source\r\n\r\nThe original database came from:\r\n\r\nhttp://greengenes.lbl.gov/Download/Sequence_Data/Fasta_data_files/Caporaso_Reference_OTUs/gg_otus_4feb2011.tgz\r\n\r\nA 16S rRNA gene library was made using V1-V3 primers and sequenced with 454 FLX the \r\n400 bp products analysed with [Qiime](qiime.org) and the the PyNAST aligned 97% OTU \r\nrepresentative sequences imported into the [ARB](http://www.arb-home.de) database. \r\nThe sequences were inserted into the reference tree using parsimony insertion.  The \r\nplacement of the short reads was used as a guide for the manual curation of the \r\ntaxonomy.\r\n\r\nDetails of the curations are in changelog.txt (in preparation...)\r\n\r\nThe curated taxonomy was exported from ARB using NDS export of the MSA_id (arb\r\n\"name\" field) and taxonomy fields. The file was reformated to comply with the\r\nformatting of the RDP classifier, using the [[check_rdp_taxfile.py]] script.\r\n","google":"<script>   (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){   (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),   m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)   })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');    ga('create', 'UA-40624996-1', 'github.io');   ga('send', 'pageview');  </script>","note":"Don't delete this file!
