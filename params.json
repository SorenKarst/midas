{"name":"MIDAS: Field guide to the microbes of activated sludge","tagline":"","body":"MIDAS is a central resource that links the most updated naming (taxonomy) and sequence data with functional information about the _in situ_ metabolism of microbes in this habitat.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate the following use cases:\r\n\r\n- **Genus/species X has been identified in my plant.** \r\n     - Are they typical (core) organisms in activated sludge?\r\n     - What function do they typically perform?\r\n     - Are these organisms occassional (transient) organisms that may be problematic for plant operation?\r\n- **I have filaments of morphology, eg. Eikelboom type 0157.**\r\n\t- Which taxonomic groups are these organisms likely to come from?  \r\n- **I am interested in a function in activated sludge.**\r\n\t- Which microbes are typically associated with this process?\r\n\t- How many organisms have been tested for this function?\r\n- **I have a sequence library derived from activated sludge.** \r\n\t - Which organisms are present? \r\n\t - How can I compare these names to those from other studies?\r\n\r\nLinking taxonomy and function\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n![MIDAS function table](URL \"https://raw.github.com/aaronsaunders/midas/master/images/MIDAS_functional_annotation.png\")\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing MIDAS for sequence classification (taxonomic assignment)\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n![MIDAS taxonomic assignment](URL \"https://raw.github.com/aaronsaunders/midas/blob/master/images/MIDAS_classification.png\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publically available databases are an invaluable resource for the scientific \r\ncommunity. However, the curation of a taxonomy over all Bacteria and Archaea is a \r\ncollosal undertaking we found that many new names were missing from the taxonomy \r\nand many of the clades of importance in activated sludge were poorly classified.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of the MIDAS database is to deliver the best and most updated taxonomy \r\nof organisms found in activated sludge ecosystem. The taxonomy strings used are derived\r\nfrom and compatible with the widely-used [Greengenes](http://greengenes.lbl.gov/) \r\ndatabase but is curated mostly at the lower taxonomic levels to improve classification \r\nat family and genus level. \r\n\r\nThe taxonomy supports a taxfile for the [RDP classifier](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classifier/)\r\nwhich we use in the [Qiime](http://qiime.org/) pipeline.\r\n\r\nSimply use midas_taxonomy.txt as the taxonomy file for running the RDP classifier \r\nin conjuction with the gg_97_otus_4feb2011.fasta in place of the standard taxfile.","google":"UA-40624996-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
