MIDAS: Field guide to the microbes of activated sludge
======================================================

MIDAS is a central resource that links the most updated naming (taxonomy) and sequence data with functional information about the _in situ_ metabolism of microbes in this habitat.

We anticipate the following use cases:

- **Genus/species X has been identified in my plant.** 
     - Are they typical (core) organisms in activated sludge?
     - What function do they typically perform?
     - Are these organisms occassional (transient) organisms that may be problematic for plant operation?
- **I have filaments of morphology, eg. Eikelboom type 0157.**
  - Which taxonomic groups are these organisms likely to come from?  
- **I am interested in a function in activated sludge.**
	- Which microbes are typically associated with this process?
	- How many organisms have been tested for this function?
- **I have a sequence library derived from activated sludge.** 
	 - Which organisms are present? 
	 - How can I compare these names to those from other studies?
