The *in situ* physiology of many organisms in the activated sludge ecosystem is extensively characterised, in part due to its amenability to *in situ* methods, such as microautoradiography (MAR) and stable-isotope probing (SIP). The ambition of the MiDAS field guide is to summarise all the knowledge about the distribution, ecology and diversity, and metabolism of the important organisms in the ecosystem.

The [MIDAS name-function table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AibK9cdlSmXgdDN5NTRnVkVZUTNfOS1KYVIzWXNZb2c&usp=sharing) begins this task. 

The information will be expanded in the coming months to include detailed *in situ* substrate specificity profiles, and putative capabilites from genomic data.
